# Project Description: Employee Management with MVC Architecture , Postman Testing and Spring Security

## Overview:
The "Employee Management" project is a Java application that employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to manage employee data. It provides functionalities for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting employee information.

## Key Components:
- **MVC Architecture:** The project is structured according to the MVC architecture, dividing the application into three distinct components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation allows for efficient data management and user interaction.
- **Spring Security:** Spring Security is used for managing user authentication and authorization. This component ensures the security of the application and protects sensitive employee data.
- **MySQL Connector:** The MySQL Connector is used to ensure connectivity to the MySQL database. This allows interaction with employee data stored in the database.
- **Spring Boot DevTools:** Spring Boot DevTools is used to facilitate automated testing and rapid development of the application. This component provides features such as automatic server restart and hot reloading during development.

## Postman Testing:
For testing and validating the application's functionalities, Postman can be used, a platform for API testing. Through Postman, users can send HTTP requests to the application's API and examine the responses received. This allows for verification of functionality correctness and identification of any issues.

## Usage and Configuration:
- **Maven Configuration:** The project is configured as a Maven project, facilitating dependency management and project building.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Users need to authenticate to access the application's functionalities. Spring Security handles this process, and users can be authorized based on defined roles and permissions.
- **Database Connectivity:** The MySQL Connector facilitates interaction with the MySQL database, where employee data is stored.
- **Automated Testing:** Spring Boot DevTools provides features for automated testing and rapid development, speeding up the development process and ensuring code quality.

## Conclusion:
The "Employee Management" project is a robust and secure application for managing employee information, using the MVC architecture and modern technologies such as Spring Security, MySQL Connector, and Spring Boot DevTools. With the help of Postman, the application's functionalities can be tested and validated, ensuring their quality and security.
